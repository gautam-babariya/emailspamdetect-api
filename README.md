# Email Spam Classification - Backend

This is the **Backend API** for the Email Spam Classification system. It handles server-side processing, such as receiving email text input, classifying it as **spam** or **not spam** using a machine learning model, and returning the classification result. The backend is built using **Node.js** and integrates with the trained machine learning model.

## Project Overview

The backend of the Email Spam Classification project serves as an API that takes an email's content as input, processes it using a pre-trained machine learning model, and returns a classification indicating whether the email is **spam** or **not spam**. The backend ensures seamless interaction between the frontend or any client application and the classification model.

## Technologies Used

- **Node.js**: JavaScript runtime for server-side development.
- **Express**: Backend framework to create RESTful APIs.
- **Python**: For machine learning model training and processing.
- **Flask** (optional): If using a Python-based API for model serving.
- **scikit-learn**: Python library for the machine learning model.
- **Nodemon**: Development tool for auto-restarting the server on changes.
- **Axios**: HTTP client for making API requests (optional).
